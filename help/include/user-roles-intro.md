Most permissions in Zulip can be granted to any combination of
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions), [groups](/help/user-groups), and
individual [users](/help/manage-a-user).

User roles make it convenient to configure permissions for your organization.
You can decide what role a user will have when you [send them an
invitation](/help/invite-new-users), and later [change a user's
role](/help/change-a-users-role#change-a-users-role) if needed.
